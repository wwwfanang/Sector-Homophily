# Sector-Homophily
This repository contains data and codes we used in support of our work "Sector Homophily Levels in Vocational Networks Across 20 Years".

This project provides the dataset of mobility network structure, network community, and companies with GICS code. In order to protect the privacy of workers, the companies' name are all hashes by sha256. And also provides the code of the main figures in our paper.
